Change Management 

As developers are located all around the world.  To enable them to work together on software projects, I keep source code in an Internet-accessible revision control system called GitHub. Users and committers have write access to the GitHub repository, enabling them to make changes to the source code.  Everyone has read access to the repositories, so you may download the most up-to-date development version of the software. If you are looking for a stable release of some source code, you should download it from the distribution directory.  The GitHub repository should only be used if you want to be on the bleeding-edge of the development effort.  The code contained in them may fail to work on your system , or it may even eat your hard drive.
